He has been neutered and vaccinated.","trackerImageUrl":"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?10990084&a=&h=","adoptionFee":"","oKWithAdults":"","obedienceTraining":"","ownerExperience":"","exerciseNeeds":"","energyLevel":"","groomingNeeds":"","yardRequired":"","fence":"","shedding":"","newPeople":"","vocal":"","activityLevel":"","earType":"","eyeColor":"","tailType":"","olderKidsOnly":"","noSmallDogs":"","noLargeDogs":"","noFemaleDogs":"","noMaleDogs":"","oKForSeniors":"","hypoallergenic":"","goodInCar":"","leashtrained":"","cratetrained":"","fetches":"","playsToys":"","swims":"","lap":"","oKWithFarmAnimals":"","drools":"","apartment":"","noHeat":"","noCold":"","protective":"","escapes":"","predatory":"","hasAllergies":"","specialDiet":"","ongoingMedical":"","hearingImpaired":"","sightImpaired":"","obedient":"","playful":"","timid":"","skittish":"","independent":"","affectionate":"","eagerToPlease":"","intelligent":"","eventempered":"","gentle":"","goofy":"","pictures":[{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_800x450.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_500x281.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_100x56.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_500x281.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_100x56.jpg","mediaID":"41852052","mediaOrder":"1","lastUpdated":"1484710357","original":{"fileSize":"46372","resolutionX":"800","resolutionY":"450","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_800x450.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"20129","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"281","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_500x281.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"2245","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"56","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852052_100x56.jpg"}},{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_800x450.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_500x281.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_100x56.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_500x281.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_100x56.jpg","mediaID":"41852053","mediaOrder":"2","lastUpdated":"1484710358","original":{"fileSize":"49503","resolutionX":"800","resolutionY":"450","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_800x450.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"21596","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"281","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_500x281.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"2398","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"56","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2070\/pictures\/animals\/10990\/10990084\/41852053_100x56.jpg"}}],"videos":[],"videoUrls":[],"mediaLastUpdated":"1484710358","contactName":"Griffith, Tonya","contactEmail":"TMSGriffith@aol.com","contactCellPhone":"","contactHomePhone":"","petUrl":"","messagePet":"Yes","needsFoster":"No"}{"orgID":"5550","animalID":"10990168","status":"Available","lastUpdated":"1492375949","rescueID":"","name":"Paxton","summary":"","species":"Dog","breed":"Dachshund (short coat)","primaryBreed":"Dachshund","secondaryBreed":"","sex":"Male","mixed":"","dogs":"No","cats":"","kids":"","declawed":"","housetrained":"","age":"Senior","birthdate":"","specialNeeds":"","altered":"","size":"Small","sizeCurrent":"0","sizePotential":"0","sizeUOM":"","uptodate":"Yes","color":"Black with Tan, Yellow or Fawn","coatLength":"Short","pattern":"","courtesy":"No","found":"No","foundDate":"","foundZipcode":"","animalLocation":"33326","killDate":"","killReason":"","description":"<div class=\"rgDescription\"><p><span style=\"font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #000080;\">Meet Paxton!

class=\"rgDescription\"><p>Pretty girl Penny is an 8yr old miniature dachshund mix, weighing in at 14lbs. When she first came into foster care, she was severely anemic - so much so that the vet was shocked that she was alive based on her bloodwork. Through months of medication, Penny has proven that she has a strong will to live...and a big love for treats!&nbsp;Week by week and month by month she gained strength and she finally has normal bloodwork! As a middle-aged lady, Penny likes a laid back lifestyle...particularly if that means she gets to be laid back with one of her favorite humans! Penny likes to walk on a leash but she also loves to be carried and cuddled. Her ideal day is a short walk and then some relaxation time with her human, followed by a nice nap and a treat. Penny can be a little slow to warm up and prefers a quiet, calm environment. We think she would really thrive in a home without young children. She will need to remain on medication to ensure that her blood levels remain normal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: This animal is NOT at Irving Animal Shelter.

When she first came into foster care, she was severely anemic - so much so that the vet was shocked that she was alive based on her bloodwork. Through months of medication, Penny has proven that she has a strong will to live...and a big love for treats! Week by week and month by month she gained strength and she finally has normal bloodwork! As a middle-aged lady, Penny likes a laid back lifestyle...particularly if that means she gets to be laid back with one of her favorite humans! Penny likes to walk on a leash but she also loves to be carried and cuddled. Her ideal day is a short walk and then some relaxation time with her human, followed by a nice nap and a treat. Penny can be a little slow to warm up and prefers a quiet, calm environment. We think she would really thrive in a home without young children. She will need to remain on medication to ensure that her blood levels remain normal.\n\n IMPORTANT: This animal is NOT at Irving Animal Shelter.

class=\"rgDescription\"><p>&nbsp;Kodiak is a shy dog looking for a family that will help him blossom into the best boy he can be!

class=\"rgDescription\"><p>Sandy is an 12-year-old female yellow lab. Her coat is long and fluffy, from nose to tail! Sandy weighs just over 80lbs. She has cataracts which make her more or less totally blind, and a large fatty lump on her right front leg. The lump has been checked by the vet and does not require any treatment.&nbsp; Sandy currently takes daily eye drops for her eyes. Being blind does not bother her, and she just goes about her business and takes life in her stride. When she bumps into a wall, she just redirects herself and tries again. If she keeps bumping into them, for example if she is in a bit of an enclosed corner, she just settles down and sleeps! One obvious change in Sandy's behavior due to her blindness is her nervousness around other dogs. Sandy always gets very excited when she smells another dog, but when they actually get really close she doesn't like them near her face, so she is best as an only dog. Also she does not cope with flights of stairs - she can handle one or two, but not lots in a row. Cats do not seem to trouble her at all.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Sandy loves to go out and walk around. She especially likes open fields and spaces where she will not keep running into things. She does not enjoy automotive travel, but will get in and out of the van under her own steam, and puts up with the travel when she has to. In the house Sandy is the perfect resident. She never scrounges food, counter surfs, gets up on furniture or makes a mess. She regularly goes 11 hours overnight without needing to go outside. She will sleep anywhere, although she avoids doggie beds and opts for a rug or blanket - something nice and stable. She seeks out human company, but is also perfectly calm and comfortable when left alone.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Sandy's list of favorite things would include visitors, belly rubs, walks, peanut butter, and sleeping. She does well with all people, and there are some people that she is especially pleased to meet. She is very peaceful, resilient, and calm, and would be happiest with a family that are not rushing about too much, enjoy gentle walking but are not avid hikers, and can spend some time each day petting her! For the right family Sandy will be a true delight, being a model of contentment and serenity.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: <strong>While this Lab may not be available for adoption by the time you complete the adoption process, other great Labs are always finding their way into our Rescue. <\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information on this Lab, please contact <a href=\"mailto:info@brooklinelabrescue.org\">info@brooklinelabrescue.org.<\/a>&nbsp; <br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>If you are interested in adopting this Lab or any other Lab from our Rescue, please visit our Web site, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brooklinelabrescue.org\/\">www.brooklinelabrescue.org<\/a>, for more information on our adoption process.

I&rsquo;m deaf due to the neglect, but I&rsquo;m used to it &amp; am comfortable with my loss of hearing. In my foster home &amp; other homes I&rsquo;ve visited, I love to follow my people around, so I&rsquo;m looking for a family with a stay at home member who would like a little buddy. I&rsquo;ve been nice with all the different dogs &amp; kitty cats I&rsquo;ve met (there have been many) &amp; I live with 2 dogs &amp; 1 cat in my foster home. I&rsquo;m a laid-back guy who likes to play just a little bit with other dogs which is cute, &amp; my favorite thing is having my ears rubbed! I&rsquo;m not a dog to be carried or a lap dog, (I&rsquo;ll growl as it makes me very uncomfortable) but I love being close to you on the couch for naps or to hang out, and I do sleep a lot on\/off during the day. I had surgery to remove my left ear canal in March 2017 due to prior severe infections, &amp; it was a really tough recovery. I had a minor follow-up surgery in Nov. 2017 &amp; still have a tiny amount of drainage which the vet thinks will always be the case, so it just needs to be cleaned once a day with a warm cloth &amp; mild antibacterial soap.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t live in an apartment\/condo home as I sing a loud song when I&rsquo;m left, or I don&rsquo;t know where you are in the home. I&rsquo;m very good on a leash &amp; enjoy going for short\/casual walks or just out to potty &amp; back, whichever you like. I&rsquo;ve come a long way since being rescued, but due to the years of neglect I suffered, I&rsquo;ll need my right ear checked &amp; likely medicated monthly. I&rsquo;m on 2 allergy meds, eat RC Hydrolyzed Protein food &amp; since I&rsquo;m a smaller dog, I don&rsquo;t eat a lot, so it&rsquo;s not expensive to feed me. At times I&rsquo;ll need an over the counter eye drop, but it&rsquo;s usually only once a week. I don&rsquo;t like them, but my foster mom can tell you how to put them in. I had my teeth cleaned, &amp; lots were pulled so my mouth is feeling great too. My potty manners are pretty good on a regular schedule, though not perfect. I&rsquo;m not crated much in my foster home, but I do well in the kitchen while my people are away. I sleep in a dog bed next to my people&rsquo;s bed at night in a closed in area. I have a temperamental side &amp; tend to protest by growling &amp; even snapping if I&rsquo;m tired &amp; it&rsquo;s time to go outside or up to bed, or if you push me, or pull me by the collar, but just put a slip leash on me &amp; I&rsquo;ll comply. Teens &amp; older please since I have that little grumpy side. I&rsquo;m looking for a patient &amp; loving family that won&rsquo;t mind my quirks &amp; will understand my challenging life and will give me the best in my golden years.&nbsp; Energy level: 3&ndash;4. I&#39;m current on vaccinations, micro-chipped, neutered &amp; my adoption fee is $100.00.&nbsp;<\/p><img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?10996272&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>","descriptionPlain":"I NEED A SPECIAL ANGEL: 9-10 years old \/ 17 lbs.

However, I need an owner who will understand that I can be skittish at times. I'm full of love to give, though! \n\nUPDATE: Adopted on 11\/2016 and returned on 01\/2017. Reason for Barbie being returned:\nBarbie was way too much for our neighborhood with houses so close together, as she barked and howled fairly often. She loved going for her daily 20 min. walk, but strained and pulled trying to get to the squirrels that are everywhere. Barbie is HIGH, HIGH energy despite her age. She really never bonded with us in 2 months. Sad to return her, but can't handle her.\nEst. D.O.B. 06\/10\/2006\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the \"Dogs\" tab. Completed applications can be emailed to our Adoption Team at petsavers@petsaversshreveport.org - all adoptions require a vet reference. Please let us know if you have any questions or if you would like to set up a meet and greet with a specific

class=\"rgDescription\">Here is a spunky senior who still has a spring in her step. Marilla has the look of a bruiser but a sweet disposition and a playful attitude. She's in good health and will make for a fun companion. Marilla has picked up quite a bit of training. She was already quite knowledgeable and obedient when she arrived at APA, so we sent her into our TOP DOG training program. She had no trouble with that, and now she's one of the best-trained dogs at the shelter. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Marilla has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Marilla successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Marilla is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Marilla after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Just because she's a serious student doesn't mean she doesn't leave time for a bit of fun. She loves to play with a rope toy, especially if she can coax a game of tug from her favorite person. She's also game for a walk. And after some exercise she's ready to catch up on her beauty sleep. Marilla is independent, but still affectionate with people. She's never needy or pushy, but she does enjoy a good scratching or belly rub. She's crate trained and will learn the rules of any home quickly. Marilla's got a lot of love to give for a lucky family! Come meet her!<img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?11003947&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>","descriptionPlain":"Here is a spunky senior who still has a spring in her step. Marilla has the look of a bruiser but a sweet disposition and a playful attitude. She's in good health and will make for a fun companion. Marilla has picked up quite a bit of training. She was already quite knowledgeable and obedient when she arrived at APA, so we sent her into our TOP DOG training program. She had no trouble with that, and now she's one of the best-trained dogs at the shelter. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Marilla has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Marilla successfully completes all the skills on her training plan, she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Marilla is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Marilla after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Just because she's a serious student doesn't mean she doesn't leave time for a bit of fun. She loves to play with a rope toy, especially if she can coax a game of tug from her favorite person. She's also game for a walk. And after some exercise she's ready to catch up on her beauty sleep. Marilla is independent, but still affectionate with people. She's never needy or pushy, but she does enjoy a good scratching or belly rub. She's crate trained and will learn the rules of any home quickly. Marilla's got a lot of love to give for a lucky family!

her!","trackerImageUrl":"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?11003947&a=&h=","adoptionFee":"","oKWithAdults":"","obedienceTraining":"","ownerExperience":"","exerciseNeeds":"","energyLevel":"","groomingNeeds":"","yardRequired":"","fence":"","shedding":"","newPeople":"","vocal":"","activityLevel":"","earType":"","eyeColor":"","tailType":"","olderKidsOnly":"","noSmallDogs":"","noLargeDogs":"","noFemaleDogs":"","noMaleDogs":"","oKForSeniors":"","hypoallergenic":"","goodInCar":"","leashtrained":"","cratetrained":"","fetches":"","playsToys":"","swims":"","lap":"","oKWithFarmAnimals":"","drools":"","apartment":"","noHeat":"","noCold":"","protective":"","escapes":"","predatory":"","hasAllergies":"","specialDiet":"","ongoingMedical":"","hearingImpaired":"","sightImpaired":"","obedient":"","playful":"","timid":"","skittish":"","independent":"","affectionate":"","eagerToPlease":"","intelligent":"","eventempered":"","gentle":"","goofy":"","pictures":[{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_480x480.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_480x480.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_100x100.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_480x480.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_100x100.jpg","mediaID":"55334768","mediaOrder":"1","lastUpdated":"1520657687","original":{"fileSize":"38176","resolutionX":"480","resolutionY":"480","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_480x480.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"38176","resolutionX":"480","resolutionY":"480","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_480x480.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"3476","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"100","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334768_100x100.jpg"}},{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_480x480.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_480x480.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_100x100.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_480x480.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_100x100.jpg","mediaID":"55334769","mediaOrder":"2","lastUpdated":"1520657688","original":{"fileSize":"44777","resolutionX":"480","resolutionY":"480","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_480x480.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"44777","resolutionX":"480","resolutionY":"480","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_480x480.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"3705","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"100","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334769_100x100.jpg"}},{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_480x480.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_480x480.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_100x100.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_480x480.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_100x100.jpg","mediaID":"55334770","mediaOrder":"3","lastUpdated":"1520657689","original":{"fileSize":"32248","resolutionX":"480","resolutionY":"480","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_480x480.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"32248","resolutionX":"480","resolutionY":"480","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_480x480.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"3535","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"100","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/5089\/pictures\/animals\/11003\/11003947\/55334770_100x100.jpg"}}],"videos":[],"videoUrls":[],"mediaLastUpdated":"1520657689","c

class=\"rgDescription\">Affectionate, Sweet, Regal Muffin is a love muffin! She needs a little time to warm up to you, but once she does she will be looking to give \"rubby-rubs\" to her humans and will happily accept a good ear and chin rub in return. When you get home she will greet you at the door and she will guard your bed with every inch of her body when you're sleeping. This lovely senior lady really knows how to make you feel special! Muffin is low-maintenance and is very energetic for a cat her age. She loves to play, especially with her favorite toy which is simple, yet so entertaining...a good ol' piece of string. She could give much younger cats lessons in proper string pouncing--none of that on the floor stuff, she catches hers while it's still up in the air! Muffin doesn't scratch on furniture and is a pro at using the litter box. She's quiet most of the time, but will start talking when she gets hungry. When it comes to being petted, she doesn't like for you to try and pet her from an angle she can't see and would prefer that you don't touch her pretty tortie tail. But, she is happy to accept love from you, as long as it's given on her terms! Muffin is stressed in the shelter environment, so the ideal home for Muffin would include a patient adopter who is willing to give her time to acclimate to her new surroundings. Muffin would be comfortable with older kids who give her the space she needs, but younger children would be a bit much for this old gal. Muffin isn't happy when she sees the other cats in her foster home. So, she may have been the only kitty in her previous household and would likely do best as the solo cat. A low-energy dog would probably be fine if a slow introduction is made. Give Muffin the love and understanding she needs and she'll spend the rest of her life returning the favor tenfold to her most special and adored person...you! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

class=\"rgDescription\">Sweet, sometimes dorky, languorous Munchkin is content to lie as close to you as humanly (or felinely) possible and napping for a good long time, while reserving the right to be lovingly stroked and\/or brushed, also for a good long time. She loves to be petted for as long as your hand can last (she always wins that game), and will purrrrrrr to let you know you're doing it \"right\". She will even lick your hand a little, grooming you as a reward for giving her pets. She is a beautiful, soft, fluffy, cuddly brown tortie, so petting her is a reward in itself. While some cats like to be busy exploring, playing, chasing, leaping, etc., that best describes Munchkin's past rather than her present. She's probably had enough fun, chased enough jingly balls and leapt upon enough devious laser dots to last a lifetime. Fifteen years, to be exact. She's earned a rest. Being the mild-mannered sweetheart that she is, Munchkin doesn't much care for excitable cats or dogs, and children would likely overwhelm her. Munchkin is looking to be the only pet in a quiet home where she can be doted on as she deserves! Previous to her stay with APA!, Munchkin's front paws had been declawed. As a result of this, she must remain an indoor cat. Munchkin does have some arthritis in her spine, which can cause discomfort and difficulty getting around, but she's now on medication for it and is feeling better. When she's in pain, she occasionally will let you know by relieving herself outside of her litterbox or on her bed. So, a little extra clean up is needed now and then. Having limited forms of communication doesn't leave many options when it comes to letting your humans know that you're hurting. She is showing some signs of early-stage kidney issues, but with a proper diet and treatment, she may well have years of cuddling left! Hey, we all get a little creaky as we get older, but we also start to realize there's nothing better than loving and being loved! And loving you is just what Munchkin wants to spend her life doing!

And if you have a vacant lap, she will take up residence in it and purr! Winnie was born with Manx Syndrome, a defect that causes her to be incontinent. This means she needs a compassionate owner who will help her express her urine a few times a day; this sounds harder than it actually is, and APA! will provide instruction on how to do it. Winnie doesn't have a tail, which is totally cute, but it is also helpful in keeping her clean - she is so accommodating! Winnie has beautiful green eyes and a sweet demeanor. She must always remain an indoor cat, but she does like to bask outside in a protected, enclosed area, such as a chicken coop or a rabbit hutch (without the chickens or rabbits, of course!). If you are looking to adopt a wonderful cat who also has special needs, we think you should meet Winnie. She will completely love you back. Contact us to meet her today!

class=\"rgDescription\">Loving, Playful, Adorable Say hello to sweet little Gracie! This gorgeous girl just wants to be with you. She'll follow you around the house, even patiently sitting outside the shower. She likes to snuggle up beside you or lay by your feet. She enjoys equal parts of playtime and nap time. She bats at mice on strings and chases other toys on her own. Gracie is a special kitty with special needs. She was left incontinent after a car accident and has limited use of her back legs. Because of her condition, Gracie needs to have her bladder expressed twice a day; and since she can't quite groom her rear end, she would greatly benefit from having a monthly shave back there to prevent matting (she's such a fluffy girl!). She has few troubles with the litter box - she kicks litter and sometimes misses the box. Sometimes when you're in the bathroom, Gracie will come running so she can have her potty time, too! She knows the drill. She is a smart, willing girl who handles her differences with dignity, and she is looking for her human companion who can do the same. Gracie has not met any children or dogs, and has enjoyed being with other cats who aren't dominant and don't bully her; sometimes other cats try to bully her, which is not nice at all, especially since Gracie is such a nice girl! Because she enjoys the company of other cats, it would be great to find a home with a cat who would accept her and be her buddy. She'd be the perfect cat for someone who wants a truly loving and devoted companion. This total sweetheart is waiting to meet her best friend and find her ideal forever home. If you're looking to make a huge difference in a little kitty's life, contact us today to meet Gracie. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

class=\"rgDescription\">Friendly, Cuddler, Precious They don't call this kitty O'Purry for nothing! This sweetheart adores cuddling in your lap and purring away. O'Purry has some special needs that make her different than your typical cat. But, her desire for affection and love are the same as any people-loving kitty as well as her happy purr. Being different doesn't matter to O'Purry, but being loved most certainly does. O'Purry has a condition that is called Manx Syndrome. This means she was born without a tail and a shorter spine than most cats which has caused her to be fecally incontinent, and she also needs her bladder expressed a couple of times a day -- we know that sounds scary, but don't worry! Her foster and our vets will walk you through how to care for O'Purry and her special needs. O'Purry is easy to express and has no problems as long as you express her regularly (morning, lunch, after work and before bed). She will probably have to wear a diaper her entire life, but she doesn't let that stop her. She is a brave kitty, takes all of this all in stride, and still plays like a happy, confident kitten! O'Purry, because of her shortened spine, also walks a bit differently than other cats. She gets around just fine, and is cute as a button! She moves more like a rabbit than a cat and can be heard hopping around from downstairs. She is able to climb up a cat tree but has to work hard to jump up on a chair. She loves to play with balls and mice and likes other cats. When O'Purry finishes her kitty games, she will seek out your lap to sit and then the o'purry sets in and she purrs and purrs with delight! Caring for a special needs pet may take less time and money than you think... and the life you'll save is priceless along with the love that you'll receive. Contact APA! to find out more about O'Purry and to set up a meet and greet with the purriest of kitties today! All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He was found downtown in a box and was practically skin and bones. Since he's been in foster care, he's gained weight and although he's generally a low-energy pup, he loves to play and even do zoomies around the house. But his favorite thing is to snuggle. Shamrock is really happy to see his foster mom when she comes home from work, wagging his entire body and giving little kisses. Especially if he sees a new toy to play tug-o-war with. Shamrock loves his female chihuahua housemate and tries to get her to play all the time. Shamrock also does extremely well on the Greenbelt and on the trail around lady bird lake. He's no runner, but he keeps up and doesn't look or care about other people or dogs. Shamrock is crate and house trained, but freely roams his apartment when his mom is away with no problems. He can stay home alone for 8-9 hours if you need him to. He doesn't really bark and he likes to nap a lot. He enjoys car rides and looking out the window as the world goes by. Shamrock does have diabetes which requires insulin shots twice a day. They're very easy to administer, and he doesn't really notice. Shamrock had glaucoma in one eye which led to the removal of the eye, but he is handling it like a champ and is pretty much the exact same dog. A home with a small yard where Shamrock could snooze and sunbathe would be a bonus, but he'll welcome any home where he can get love and affection.

For more information, please contact APA! In addition to people, Holly George is social with other cats, too, and would love to have a feline buddy (or two) to hang out with in his new home. He has grown up around cats of all ages and accepts all of them. He will snuggle with them and groom them, and he will play with them, too! He also likes a variety of toys - balls, string toys, feather toys - and a scratching post to scratch and climb. He is young and active! Holly George has some special needs, and we think the perfect home for him is with patient people who will love and appreciate him! His human companion should be able to express his bladder and keep him clean (he is a little sensitive around his back end, so he likes to be handled gently); other than that, all Holly George needs is company, love and affection, and to be played with. He would be best with adults and young adults, rather than little kids. Though Holly George is friendly and outgoing, he likely will need time to adapt to his new home and family.

There's just something about a vibrant orange fluffball happily climbing into your lap, kneading away and drifting off to sleep that makes you feel all cozy and...well...that just makes you want to sing! George not only adores people, he loves playing with other cats and to snuggle and get baths from them. He also enjoys gazing out the window with a kitty friend by his side. He has a wonderful purr and is just as content snuggling and sleeping as he is playing. When George does play, he loves a go-round with a rascally string toy or trying to take down those pesky laser pointers! George is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. George is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2FwYCxR George is under the weather sometimes and takes medication that helps him feel better. He is such a lovebug, you won't find a sweeter cat! This little fellow also has impeccable manners, always using his litterbox and only scratching his toys, not the furniture! George would absolutely thrive in a loving home where a lap or two is readily available and with human friends who are comfortable giving him the medical care he needs to keep this precious guy as healthy as possible. Young kids may be a bit much for him, but gentle older children and adults would most certainly keep his purr motor going strong. Contact APA! today to meet this orange delight!

She's a senior gal who is more interested in naps and pets than in racing about the house and bouncing off walls. She can be a little shy at first, but once she has gotten to know you, you could not ask for a more affectionate cat. She loves to be curled up by your side while you watch Netflix, or read a good book, or play X-box. Mia loves attention, and would love a home where her special people are home a lot to give her the affection she craves. She would be the perfect fit for a housebound senior, or a young professional who has a home office! Or a homemaker who will let her sit at their side as they take care of their house. Mia has Chronic Renal Disease, which means her kidneys are not functioning as well as they once were. This condition is so common in older cats that APA! offers a special adoption package for them. Read more about renal failure and adoption details here: http:\/\/www.austinpetsalive.org\/2016\/03\/lives-worth-saving-cats-in-renal-failure We can tell you this: it will be well worth the extra care to have this sweet face greet you at the door every day. Mia gets along fine with the other cats in the cattery, so would do well with a calm feline companion with a similar low-key activity level. Or she could flourish as an only cat, and keep all your attention for herself! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

Hayden is a handsome fellow, always dressed to the nines in a tasteful gray tux. You can tell he's got the Emily Post manners thing down, because he uses the litter box like a gent, and he minds the furniture as well. Right-o! Hayden has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and\/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! But he is splendid about taking his medicine. No fuss at all. That would be bad form. He is rather enthusiastic about food, which is probably caused by the diabetes; but of course he is polite and well-behaved about it. And he's an affectionate cuddler. If he could talk, he'd probably recite a bit of Shelley or Byron while lounging in your lap. His ideal home would be with someone who would love him and give him affection. He would do likely be fine with other pets, and even kids.

It took a little while for them to befriend Rocky and get close enough to start petting him, but once that trust was established, it was clear Rocky did belong to someone at some point and simply became fearful of humans as a protective defense mechanism for survival. Because they were feeding, they did the responsible thing by having him neutered and vaccinated. After only a few short months he would let them pick him up and brush him. He also became good friends with their other cats. They reached out for help in finding him a real home to give him a chance at a good life and not just being outdoors the rest of his life. Rocky is FIV positive, which is not uncommon with cats living outdoors especially unneutered males fighting for territory. In our book, FIV is nothing to be concerned about but an indoor, stress free life is recommended. Rocky is around three years old and has the most endearing fluffy face and cauliflower ear. He has a quirky and adorable personality.
