We're desperate for foster homes-- help!! <br \/><br \/>The primary role of the foster home is to evaluate the new Eskie as to health, behavior and temperament, as follows:<br \/><br \/>HEALTH<br \/>Determine what medical needs the Eskie has, such as routine vaccinations, heartworm tests (and heartworm treatment, if necessary), being spayed\/neutered, having their teeth cleaned, etc. In the case of our more severely abused or neglected dogs, the foster home ensures that the dog gets the medical attention required to get him\/her back to optimal health. <br \/><br \/>BEHAVIOR AND TEMPERAMENT<br \/>1. Evaluate the dog for behavioral issues and work to correct any undesirable traits exhibited by the dog. These may include not being housebroken, needing basic obedience training (including learning to walk on a leash), excessive barking, etc. <br \/><br \/>2. Evaluate the dog's temperament: is he\/she friendly, aggressive, shy, scared, submissive? How does the dog get along with other dogs, cats, children, men, women, strangers, and so on? The foster home will then be responsible for providing the proper training and socialization needed to make the dog adoptable.<br \/><br \/>After the assessment and vetting of the dog, the foster home provides ERU with bio information and pictures, so the dog can be posted on ERU's website and on Petfinder.com. Sometimes our foster homes also participate in adoption events that provide additional exposure both to the foster dog and to Eskie Rescuers United.<br \/><br \/>ERU pays for the cost of all vetting and medical needs of our foster dogs, including heartworm and flea\/tick medications. The foster home provides for the dog's food, treats and toys and is not reimbursed for those expenses by ERU. <br \/><br \/>Fostering a rescue dog can be a lot of work and responsibility. Some of these dogs were never provided proper socialization or medical care, and therefore are not perfectly behaved or impeccably groomed. MANY of our fosters come from deplorable situations and may need a lot of tender loving care to get them cleaned up, be taught how to trust again, or just simply realize what it's like to be loved and cherished! <br \/><br \/>Before applying to become a new foster home, please ask yourself (and your family members) if you have enough time and patience, as well as the understanding of the Eskie breed, to care properly for a rescue dog.

Please click the donation button below to make a tax-deductible donation through PayPal and help make a difference to even one American Eskimo dog!","trackerImageUrl":"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?70890&a=&h=","adoptionFee":"","oKWithAdults":"","obedienceTraining":"","ownerExperience":"","exerciseNeeds":"","energyLevel":"","groomingNeeds":"","yardRequired":"","fence":"","shedding":"","newPeople":"","vocal":"","activityLevel":"","earType":"","eyeColor":"","tailType":"","olderKidsOnly":"","noSmallDogs":"","noLargeDogs":"","noFemaleDogs":"","noMaleDogs":"","oKForSeniors":"","hypoallergenic":"","goodInCar":"","leashtrained":"","cratetrained":"","fetches":"","playsToys":"","swims":"","lap":"","oKWithFarmAnimals":"","drools":"","apartment":"","noHeat":"","noCold":"","protective":"","escapes":"","predatory":"","hasAllergies":"","specialDiet":"","ongoingMedical":"","hearingImpaired":"","sightImpaired":"","obedient":"","playful":"","timid":"","skittish":"","independent":"","affectionate":"","eagerToPlease":"","intelligent":"","eventempered":"","gentle":"","goofy":"","pictures":[{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_500x500.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_500x500.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_100x100.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_500x500.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_100x100.jpg","mediaID":"18253263","mediaOrder":"1","lastUpdated":"1384894057","original":{"fileSize":"26626","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"500","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_500x500.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"26626","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"500","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_500x500.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"2462","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"100","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/18253263_100x100.jpg"}},{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_500x500.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_500x500.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_100x100.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_500x500.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_100x100.jpg","mediaID":"118938","mediaOrder":"2","lastUpdated":"1384894057","original":{"fileSize":"26626","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"500","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_500x500.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"26626","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"500","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_500x500.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"2462","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"100","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/152\/pictures\/animals\/70\/70890\/118938_100x100.jpg"}}],"videos":[],"videoUrls":[],"mediaLastUpdated":"1384894057","contactName":"","contactEmail":"","contactCellPhone":"","contactHomePhone":"","petUrl":"","messagePet":"Yes","needsFoster":"No"}{"orgID":"637","animalID":"80179","status":"Available","lastUpdated":"1520523428","rescueID":"","name":"Britta","summary":"","species":"Dog","breed":"Pointer \/ Terrier \/ Mixed (short coat)","primaryBreed":"Pointer","secondaryBreed":"Terrier","sex":"Female","mixed":"Yes","dogs":"Yes","cats":"No","kids":"Yes","declawed":"","housetrained":"Yes","age":"Adult","birthdate":"9\/18\/2012","specialNeeds":"No","altered":"","size":"Medium","sizeCurrent":"0","sizePotential":"0","sizeUOM":"Pounds","uptodate":"Yes","color":"White with Brown or Chocolate","coatLength":"Short","pattern":"","courtesy":"No","found":"No","foundDate":"","foundZipcode":"","animalLocation":"92629","killDate":"","killReason":"","description":"<div class=\"rgDescription\"><p>Britta is a 4 yr.&nbsp;old girl who is looking for a furever family.

people for the first time! He&#39;s a gorgeous black cat, tall and sleek. It might take a little time to get over his shyness, but once he trusts you he is a faithful friend. He enjoys pets, but he is often too busy to sit on laps, He would make a nice roommate for a busy person. Guinness gets along well with other cats. He enjoys their company, and would probably like to have at least one feline sibling in his family, but he could adjust to being an only cat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Background info- I was born at Kitty Corner June 23, 2007. My mom was pregnant when she was thrown out of a car in front of the Blarney Stone in Tipp Hill, Syracuse.

He&#39;s a gorgeous black cat, tall and sleek. It might take a little time to get over his shyness, but once he trusts you he is a faithful friend. He enjoys pets, but he is often too busy to sit on laps, He would make a nice roommate for a busy person. Guinness gets along well with other cats. He enjoys their company, and would probably like to have at least one feline sibling in his family, but he could adjust to being an only cat.\n\n Background info- I was born at Kitty Corner June 23, 2007. My mom was pregnant when she was thrown out of a car in front of the Blarney Stone in Tipp Hill, Syracuse. Mom went into labor, and a nice person helped mom out and brought her to Kitty Corner to care for her and her kittens. I have been living here at the rescue since I was a kitten. I have been waiting for my turn to be adopted all of my life.\n\n  If you would like to give this senior a chance to have a comfortable retirement home of his own, please fill out the adoption application at www.kittycorner.org \n\n Guinness tests negative for Feline Leukemia and FIV, is neutured, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines.\n\n If your cat needs to be rehomed at any time, just bring them back to us. We want to be sure that none of our cats is ever homeless again.\n\n Thank you for looking at our cats! 4\/13\/18 9:37

The Rescue is down to our lowest number of foster homes in 5 years. Sadly, the demand for more homes is high, in large part due to the struggling economy and the added burden of homeless dogs in area Shelters.\n\n  \n\n K9 Lifeline Rescue+ volunteer foster homes can request either large, medium or small breed dogs or puppies to foster and can also specify a certain breed. K9LLR provides our foster homes with crates. We also vaccinate and alter all of our dogs and puppies at the expense of the Rescue.

We're thinking he might be a good training partner for a Navy SEAL or maybe someone training for an Iron Man competition - we challenge you to keep up with our D-Man!\n\n Dalton is a good boy in his crate and loves car rides and playing fetch. He is definitely a high energy boy who will need to go to an experienced bully home. Did we mention he's got a remarkable vertical leap? Dalton would probably do best paired with a submissive female or as an only dog. As far as people go, he loves everybody - he'll bounce up to your eye level just to show you! He will greatly benefit from anybody willing to give him the training and extensive exercise that he needs.\n\nDalton is recommended for a home with children over the age of 12 and will require a fully fenced yard.\n\n\n**Before meeting any Buster dog an application must be

Judith was used for breeding and received very little positive human interaction.&nbsp; She is very nervous around other dogs and because of this, needs to be the only pet in the home.<\/p>\r\n<p

He loves to cuddle and snuggle.\n\n \n \n Please check back on Biggs as he settled into his foster home and we learn a bit more about him.\n\n\n \n All Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay\/neutered and on monthly heartworm preventative.

She loves people, children and most other dogs; however, she is selective about which doggy friends she plays with. When she wants something, or wants to go out, she sings. She has a very good voice.

I have lots of love to give. Will you give me a chance?\n\n  \n\n Here are some very important things you need to know about me\n\n  \n\n Approximate age\/birthdate: March 17, 2008\n\nWeight\/size: 60 lbs\n\nHousebroken: YES ... as long as you do your part and get her outside 4-5 times\/day\n\nCrate trained: YES &ndash; does NOT like staying in a crate and protests\n\nPersonality: alpha female, playful, loving, bossy, territorial, stubborn\n\n  \n\n Energy level: medium with bursts of high\n\nFenced yard required?:  YES &ndash; the husky in her makes her a &lsquo;runner&rsquo;. Must be a physical fence - no exceptions\n\n  \n\n Does he\/she jump fences? NO &ndash; she could, but if she is happy she doesn&rsquo;t\n\n  \n\n Leash walk: YES but still pulls &ndash; with more practice, she would be fine\n\nObedience training: Knows &lsquo;sit&rsquo; and &lsquo;off&rsquo; &ndash; smart and could train easily with proper motivation. She is very smart, but stubborn\n\n \nRiding in vehicles: RIDES OK but is not her favorite thing to do.   \n\nSpayed\/neutered:  YES\n\nUp-to-date on routine vaccinations:  YES\n\nMicrochipped:  NO\n\nSocial with other dogs: If properly introduced she will do fine. She is very alpha when meeting new dogs and needs to be supervised. Not good with much smaller dogs.\n\nSocial with cats: NO CATS &ndash; true to her breed mixes, she has a high prey drive and could be a danger to smaller animals including smaller dogs\n\nGood with children:  She will be fine with older, respectful children. Her size and energy and her territorial nature will be overwhelming for small\/young children\n\n  \n\n Adoption fee: $75\n\n  \n\n ZuZu is a wonderful mutt girl &ndash; mom is a spaniel\/lab and dad is a husky\/malamute. ZuZu is a generally an energetic, playful girl who gets along with everybody &ndash; but she must be properly introduced to new dogs in order to accept them as part of her pack. She enjoys the company of other dogs and but might be even happier as an only dog as long as her family keeps her socialized with other dogs. She is an alpha female and she really wants to be the boss &hellip; but she wants to have friends. Her social skills just aren&rsquo;t always the best.  ZuZu is not a good choice for first time dog owners. She needs a strong pack leader with big dog experience and one who will work with her consistently to curb her energetic assertiveness. \n\nZuZu was crate-trained and housebroken early in life and was leash-walked daily. Due to some changes in her life, she grew to dislike the crate. She has nice house manners, but she really loves to play outside so having a fenced yard is very important to her. When she is bored she will find things to amuse herself, so she needs to have a family that will include her in their activities and keep her challenged. When she has finally played out, you will find her napping in a sunny spot.\n\nIf you think ZuZu might be the perfect pup for you, please go to www.allamericanmuttrescue.org, click on Forms\/Application and complete your adoption application online. \n\n We are an all-volunteer group, so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions and home visits. You can expedite the process by providing accurate email addresses for all your references. Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have 10 or more applications in process. We make every effort to move through them as quickly as possible.\n\n  \n\n When your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if ZuZu picks you too. \n\n If it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee, and an adoption contract to be signed. \n\n Please feel free to email weluvpups@hotmail.com if you have additional questions.","trackerImageUrl":"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?876655&a=&h=","adoptionFee":"","oKWithAdults":"","obedienceTraining":"","ownerExperience":"","exerciseNeeds":"","energyLevel":"","groomingNeeds":"","yardRequired":"","fence":"","shedding":"","newPeople":"","vocal":"","activityLevel":"","earType":"","eyeColor":"","tailType":"","olderKidsOnly":"","noSmallDogs":"","noLargeDogs":"","noFemaleDogs":"","noMaleDogs":"","oKForSeniors":"","hypoallergenic":"","goodInCar":"","leashtrained":"","cratetrained":"","fetches":"","playsToys":"","swims":"","lap":"","oKWithFarmAnimals":"","drools":"","apartment":"","noHeat":"","noCold":"","protective":"","escapes":"","predatory":"","hasAllergies":"","specialDiet":"","ongoingMedical":"","hearingImpaired":"","sightImpaired":"","obedient":"","playful":"","timid":"","skittish":"","independent":"","affectionate":"","eagerToPlease":"","intelligent":"","eventempered":"","gentle":"","goofy":"","pictures":[{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_2600x1950.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_500x375.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_100x75.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_500x375.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_100x75.jpg","mediaID":"35888030","mediaOrder":"1","lastUpdated":"1466615415","original":{"fileSize":"1120535","resolutionX":"2600","resolutionY":"1950","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_2600x1950.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"29814","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"375","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"2911","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"75","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888030_100x75.jpg"}},{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_3264x2448.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_500x375.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_100x75.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_500x375.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_100x75.jpg","mediaID":"35888082","mediaOrder":"2","lastUpdated":"1466615585","original":{"fileSize":"929346","resolutionX":"3264","resolutionY":"2448","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_3264x2448.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"25350","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"375","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"2426","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"75","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/35888082_100x75.jpg"}},{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_500x375.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_500x375.jpg","smallUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_100x75.jpg","fullsizeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_500x375.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_100x75.jpg","mediaID":"9523357","mediaOrder":"3","lastUpdated":"1466615585","original":{"fileSize":"39270","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"375","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_500x375.jpg"},"large":{"fileSize":"39270","resolutionX":"500","resolutionY":"375","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_500x375.jpg"},"small":{"fileSize":"3466","resolutionX":"100","resolutionY":"75","url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523357_100x75.jpg"}},{"originalUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/filestore.rescuegroups.org\/2449\/pictures\/animals\/876\/876655\/9523359_222x300.jpg","largeUrl":"https:\/\/s3.amaz

Rocket loves people and wants to please you in any way he can. \n\n Rocket has been neutered, treated for heartworms, is current on vaccinations and is microchipped. If you are interested in adopting Rocket, please fill out the adoption application located at www.furrykidsreufge.org\/adoptadog and a dedicated volunteer will get back with you as soon as possible. Thanks for your interest in Rocket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Furry Kids' Refuge is in need of good quality dog and puppy food with meat as the first ingredient.

Nevertheless, Chandler adores attention and being held and petted. So much so, he has some jealousy issues with other dogs. Come visit this wonderful Scottie boy, and consider giving him a life-long home that he can call his own! Chandler is approximately 10yo.    \n\n  All dogs adopted by Scottie Kingdom Rescue, Inc. have had a full medical exam by one of our licensed Veterinarians, which includes testing (and treatment, if necessary) for Heartworm disease, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis, all necessary vaccinations, spay\/neuter surgery, dental cleaning as necessary, microchipping, registration of the microchip, and any other medical needs each particular dog may need. Copies of all available medical records are transferred to you when the adoption is finalized. \n\n \n    We prefer to adopt to families with past Scottie, Westie, Terrier (or similar) experience, but realize this isn&rsquo;t always possible. We do not ship our pets. If you have that special place in your heart, and in your home, for a Scottie (or any of our other available rescue dogs), please visit us in Dallas for an in person meet &amp; greet session with our available dogs. If you have existing dogs, they must travel to Dallas with you, so we can be assured that they will be compatible with the new addition to your family.    \n \n     Please contact us at         Rescue@scottiekingdom.com         to receive an Adoption Application or for more information on our Adoption process. Also, please take the time to visit our website         www.scottiekingdom.com         for additional information.    \n \n    We sometimes receive several applications on the same dog. Our goal is to place the dog in the best home possible, based on his\/her needs, personality and past history. Please note: Adoptions are not done on a first come, first served basis. Submitting an application does not guarantee the adoption of any dog.  We are looking for the best available home for each of our rescue dogs.\n \n Thank you for your understanding, and for considering adoption!    \n \n Donations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n Donate@scottiekingdom.com\n or via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX

He had no contact with people or other dogs for a very long time. This is a progress in work. Jack is a good boy, and is a well-behaved dog, obedient and eager to please. He needs a guardian who is familiar with the Bully breed, who will work with him. He has a moderate energy level, but can be rambunctious (so no small children). We are sure you will fall in love.
