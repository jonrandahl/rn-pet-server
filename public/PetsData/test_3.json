He has since been groomed and will take glamour shots at our adoption event this weekend with our volunteer photography team.\n\n   \n\n  Please do not judge a dog by the neglect of a former owner. NickNack is a great guy who is happy and loving. He is now clean and being treated for the skin and ear infections he had related to the flea infestation and neglect and he feels SO much better. He will be continuing treatment for the next 3-4 weeks and after that will have no ongoing medication. UPDATE 12\/21\/17 -- he has recovered from his skin and ear infections\n\n   \n\n  Our vet has placed him on FirstMate Pet Foods Senior variety (dry) food as it is grain free (skin friendly) and easy on his senior system. It can be purchased locally from Pet Food Express or ordered online at Chewy.com\n\n   \n\n  NIckNack gets along with other dogs and with all people. He did not bother the cats at our vet clinic and is doing well with the ones in his foster home. He seems to be housebroken. He is crate trained and leash trained. As a non-shedding dog, he will need to be professionally groomed every 4-6 weeks to prevent him from ever looking like a swamp monster again.\n\n  \n\n He does like to \"talk\" a lot... so apartment life may not be the best for him. \n\n   \n\n  He qualifies for our Seniors for Seniors program where all dogs aged 5+ can be adopted to people 55+ for $5. Adoptions to US Military Veterans are always free. All regular adoption criteria apply and application required.\n\n   \n\n  We adopt to anyone willing to come to us to meet him.

My mom took the dog and I went with my dad. However, my dad went off to fight in Afghanistan. The nice people at CARA graciously took me in, but I was so scared and confused that I wasn&rsquo;t eating or using the litter box. So these nice board members took me to their home and gave me my own bedroom until I am comfortable in my temporary surroundings. There are several dogs and cats at my foster home, which is scary, but I am eating, sleeping on the bed and using the litter box. My foster moms come in frequently to spend time with me. I am starting to feel<br>\r\ncomfortable with them so I come out from hiding for some much needed love and affection.<br>\r\nBoy do I like to be pet, especially my belly. My purr has a wonderful melody. If you are looking<br>\r\nfor an only cat that will love you, keep your lap warm in the winter and be thankful for a fur-<br>\r\never home, please consider me. Oh, I almost forgot. I am declawed, which I know will be<br>\r\nextremely inviting to some people out there.<\/p><img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?12156908&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div><div class=\"rgFooter\"><br><p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 5px; border: 0px; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><strong>To see more animals for adoption, please visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cara-nc.org\/\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(115, 50, 214); cursor: pointer; \" target=\"_blank\">CARA Website<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 5px; border: 0px; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 128); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Our adoption fees are:<br>\r\nDogs: $155<br>\r\nCats: $95<br>\r\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S\/N Deposit: $100<br>\r\nKittens under 4 months: $70&nbsp;plus S\/N Deposit: $100<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 5px; border: 0px; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">All pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions <a href=\"http:\/\/cara.rescuegroups.org\/info\/adoption\"> \r\n<span style=\"color:#0000CD;\">here<\/span>\r\n<\/a>), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped.

To apply read about our adoption policies  here  to fill out an application.\n\n\nMy name is Minnie and I came to CARA because my mom and dad got a divorce. My mom took the dog and I went with my dad. However, my dad went off to fight in Afghanistan. The nice people at CARA graciously took me in, but I was so scared and confused that I wasn&rsquo;t eating or using the litter box. So these nice board members took me to their home and gave me my own bedroom until I am comfortable in my temporary surroundings. There are several dogs and cats at my foster home, which is scary, but I am eating, sleeping on the bed and using the litter box. My foster moms come in frequently to spend time with me. I am starting to feel\n comfortable with them so I come out from hiding for some much needed love and affection.\n Boy do I like to be pet, especially my belly. My purr has a wonderful melody. If you are looking\n for an only cat that will love you, keep your lap warm in the winter and be thankful for a fur-\n ever home, please consider me. Oh, I almost forgot. I am declawed, which I know will be\n extremely inviting to some people out there.\n\n\n\n\nTo see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\n Our adoption fees are:\n Dogs: $155\n Cats: $95\n Puppies under 4 months: $115 plus S\/N Deposit: $100\n Kittens under 4 months: $70 plus S\/N Deposit: $100\n\n All pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions  here ), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped.

He does well with other large dogs and kids and he&#39;s friendly with people after getting a chance to sniff and meet them. Simba does need a slow introduction to smaller dogs though and it&#39;s not known how is with cats so we would say no for now. He is a major cuddle bug...but loves his squeaky toys\/balls!

Or email citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us&nbsp; About Our Shelter... CITY DOGS Cleveland is a program of Cleveland Animal Care &amp;amp; Control (CACC), located at 2690 W. 7th St. Cleveland, OH 44113. Public hours are Monday through Saturday from 10am-3pm, and Sunday 12-2pm. The CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.&nbsp; Our Adoption Process... Here&#39;s a little about how things work: All of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. A handful of dogs are only available for rescue pull, which can be for a variety of reasons. You can either stop in during our open hours to meet a dog, or set up a meet and greet with your dog, which allows us to get the dog out of his\/her cage for some exercise before you arrive. To set up a meet and greet, please email us at citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us. About Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through the ASPCA SAFER Assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. Our dogs are strays and we cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog. We do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if they are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption. Heath\/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within a week or so of leaving the kennel. They do have their DHPP, Rabies and Bordetella vaccinations, are dewormed once and have a microchip. In addition, unfortunately many of the dogs do get kennel cough. This is not something that is contagious to people at all, but dogs that do have it will need to be on an antibiotic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical qualities-&nbsp; back to top&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical qualities-&nbsp; back to top&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical qualities-&nbsp; back to top&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical qualities-&nbsp; back to top&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical qualities-&nbsp; back to top &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical qualities-&nbsp; back to top&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical qualities-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"backtotop\" style=\"font-family: Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: right; padding: 3px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rescuegroups.org\/manage\/animal?animalID=12159274#top\" style=\"color: rgb(38, 77, 115);\">back to top<\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?12159427&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div><div class=\"rgFooter\"><br><address>Please consider a donation to PBRC. &nbsp; Your donations make a difference to&nbsp;countless&nbsp;dogs through spay\/neuter,&nbsp;educating the public, promoting a positive image&nbsp;and finding them permanent homes.&nbsp; Donate :&nbsp;http:\/\/www.pbrc.net\/donate.html<\/address>\r\n<\/div>","descriptionPlain":"Please contact City Dogs - Cleveland Animal Care and Control (tylersgirl815@aim.com) for more information about this pet.\n\n\n  \n\n  *Provided by    PBRC Courtesy Dog Listings      **Please Note - Dogs Available Nationwide - * check (state) before applying.

She's energetic but extremely cuddly, she's rather large (about 50-60lbs) but will sit right on your lap if you let her. She has had babies, but is fixed now and has all of her shots per the shelter she was in. She's been through formal training and is great around children. We actually have a cat as well but she generally keeps to herself so the dog doesn't see her much. She is only about 3 we believe, but she doesn't chew or destroy anything. Of course she would come with all of her items: leash, collar, raised food and water dishes, food, toys. We love her, it breaks out heart to see her go, but we can no longer accommodate her.

class=\"rgDescription\">Alexander has a skip in his step now that he's been rescued from Hurricane Harvey and made his way to a safe, secure shelter. All he wants now is to move on to a new forever home. Alexander is a super lovebug and greets everyone with a smile. Before long, he's rolled over on his back looking for belly-rubs. Alexander loves giving hugs to his new human friends and seems to adore everyone he meets. He's also very playful - Alexander loves to play catch and tug of war, and if nothing else, he'll entertain himself running around holding his own leash. While Alexander is full of energy during playtime, he is also well-mannered and knows when to chill out and settle for some cuddle time. One of his APA! friends says \"he just radiates calmness.\" That's until you show him a toy, then he's ready to party! Another favorite quirk of Alexander's is how happy he looks when he rolls around on the ground to scratch his back. He loves going for rides in the car and also, very adorably, in a golf cart. On top of being all around adorable, Alexander is a rockstar in his TOP Dog training. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Alexander has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free\" and coming when called.

Come meet this sweet boy!<img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?12161741&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>","descriptionPlain":"Alexander has a skip in his step now that he's been rescued from Hurricane Harvey and made his way to a safe, secure shelter. All he wants now is to move on to a new forever home. Alexander is a super lovebug and greets everyone with a smile. Before long, he's rolled over on his back looking for belly-rubs. Alexander loves giving hugs to his new human friends and seems to adore everyone he meets. He's also very playful - Alexander loves to play catch and tug of war, and if nothing else, he'll entertain himself running around holding his own leash. While Alexander is full of energy during playtime, he is also well-mannered and knows when to chill out and settle for some cuddle time. One of his APA! friends says \"he just radiates calmness.\" That's until you show him a toy, then he's ready to party! Another favorite quirk of Alexander's is how happy he looks when he rolls around on the ground to scratch his back. He loves going for rides in the car and also, very adorably, in a golf cart. On top of being all around adorable, Alexander is a rockstar in his TOP Dog training. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Alexander has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free\" and coming when called. Once Alexander successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready!

I might argue with you or bark (a high pitched yelp) so I need someone who understands me and has the patience to teach me other ways to communicate. I also have a small habit of &quot;nipping&quot; when I first see you in the morning but I don&#39;t mean any harm. I just Luvz everyone! Usually all you have to do is say &quot;Hank house&quot; and I will quite down. If I don&#39;t then you can be pretty sure I&#39;m letting you know I need to go potty. I really believe this little fur balls that run around teasing me and meowing at me were put on earth just to torture me so I prefer not to live with one if possible. Hank out for now!   \n\n\n\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n \n Please join us at our next Event(s):\n\n Current Scheduled

Young or old, Ira loves everyone. \n\n \n Ira was recently treated for heartworms - please let SHH know if you have any questions.","trackerImageUrl":"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?12163502&a=&h=","adoptionFee":"350.00","oKWithAdults":"All","obedienceTraining":"","ownerExperience":"","exerciseNeeds":"Moderate","energyLevel":"Moderate","groomingNeeds":"","yardRequired":"","fence":"","shedding":"","newPeople":"Friendly","vocal":"","activityLevel":"Moderately

Fee: $300.00&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Foster:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Jack is a naughty, sassy, old man that adores attention and knows some solid commands (sit, down (lie down), off, wait, and touch). He&#39;s a counter surfer that knows the word &quot;off&quot; and will throw his head back, bark, and run to you wagging his booty to tell you that he wouldn&#39;t have to counter surf if you&#39;d just feed him all the things on the counter. Sass.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">He&#39;s crate trained in the sense that he doesn&#39;t destroy any bedding or make any messes, but he&#39;s very vocal about his displeasure of being kenneled like a &quot;dog&quot;. In a new environment he may be vocal for up to an hour before settling, His ideal home would require no kenneling but he does chill out once on a schedule. I would call him potty trained despite his short boycott of going outside to potty when it first got cold (literally one day, one accident inside). Jack is a master cuddler and would most likely excel if put to work as a therapy doggo for the elderly and at children&#39;s hospitals since he automatically sits and adores pets from anyone willing to indulge. He&#39;s a gentle guy that doesn&#39;t jump on new friends unless they decide to ignore him after his perfect patient sit and wait for scritches. Jack loves a good walk and likes to stop and say hi to every human he passes. He has a calm demeanor and sweet waggy tail that draws everyone to him.&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Jack would benefit from someone with breed experience (boxer, pittie, intelligent, maybe a tad manipulative). He&#39;s eager to please when you&#39;re fair in your requests.

He&#39;s a counter surfer that knows the word &quot;off&quot; and will throw his head back, bark, and run to you wagging his booty to tell you that he wouldn&#39;t have to counter surf if you&#39;d just feed him all the things on the counter. Sass.\n\n  \n\n He&#39;s crate trained in the sense that he doesn&#39;t destroy any bedding or make any messes, but he&#39;s very vocal about his displeasure of being kenneled like a &quot;dog&quot;. In a new environment he may be vocal for up to an hour before settling, His ideal home would require no kenneling but he does chill out once on a schedule. I would call him potty trained despite his short boycott of going outside to potty when it first got cold (literally one day, one accident inside). Jack is a master cuddler and would most likely excel if put to work as a therapy doggo for the elderly and at children&#39;s hospitals since he automatically sits and adores pets from anyone willing to indulge. He&#39;s a gentle guy that doesn&#39;t jump on new friends unless they decide to ignore him after his perfect patient sit and wait for scritches. Jack loves a good walk and likes to stop and say hi to every human he passes. He has a calm demeanor and sweet waggy tail that draws everyone to him. \n\n  \n\n Jack would benefit from someone with breed experience (boxer, pittie, intelligent, maybe a tad manipulative). He&#39;s eager to please when you&#39;re fair in your requests. He walks nicely on leash if you give him some guidance. \n\n  \n\n Jack has not been around cats at my house but I&#39;d guess he is capable of living peacefully with kitties. Jack is pretty cool with other dogs but gets a bit awkward when over stimulated. I&#39;d say he would benefit from slower intros if you have a dominant dogs. I have not seen any type of aggression from him but I&#39;ve not put him any situations where he has to make his own decisions with dominant dogs. \n\n  \n\n He&#39;s a super sweet, adorable dude that

With a little love, attention and time, she has become a sweet, playful kitty who loves humans. She really enjoys being pet and will give little &quot;nose kisses&quot; when she wants your attention. She can do really cool acrobatic flips and leaps when she plays with her favorite toy, which is a catnip filled mouse attached to a string. She almost always wants to play, and will walk over to her toy and put her paw on it while making little tiny meows that sound like a kitten. She uses the litterbox faithfully and isn&#39;t picky about food or treats. She doesn&#39;t shed much, and has a nice, loud purr that she uses often. She just wants to be loved! Blaine is currently living comfortably in her foster mom&#39;s basement, but after her friend Quinn was adopted she has started to get lonely. She loves other cats, calm dogs, and friendly people.
